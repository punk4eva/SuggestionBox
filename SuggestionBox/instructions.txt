HOW TO PUSH/PULL FROM GITHUB ON NETBEANS:
1. To pull: Right-click project name > Git > Remote > Pull

Then Right-click > Git > Remote > Push.

There are special sections which only you can do labelled @charlie. (Just Ctrl-F '@charlie') If there are pieces of code which you want me 
to do, put an @adam tag.

The actual users are stored in the users.txt file. Always access them through the UserLog class which I have instanciated in your 
MainClass. For info on how to use the UserLog, read the Javadocs. PS: You can instantly read the Javadoc for a method by selecting it from
the drop-down menu that arises by typing the method name in Netbeans. PSS: You should never have to use the pull() method.


>>>>>>>>Did you install a library called 'javaee-web-api-7.0'? If you did, reinstall it, push, and then delete this message.
